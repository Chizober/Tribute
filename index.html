      Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (1918 – 2013) was a <em>South African revolutionary and politician</em> who is most
      famous for fighting against institutionalized discrimination against blacks in his country, known as
      <em>Apartheid</em>. Mandela began his political career in the 1940s and soon became a prominent member of the
      African National Congress (ANC) by leading its youth wing. He spent 27 years of his life in prison from 1964 till
      1990. After his release, he and President F. W. de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid. In 1994, Nelson Mandela
      became the <em>first black President of South Africa</em> by leading his party to victory in the first multiracial
      elections in the country. During his presidency, he worked towards <em>national reconciliation</em>. Mandela
      received more than 260 honors during his life including the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize.
      Nelson Mandela could have left prison a bitter man, but as he once famously remarked:<q>I knew if I didn’t leave
        my bitterness and hatred behind, I’d still be in prison.</q>Nelson Mandela’s message will not disappear. It will
      continue to inspire fighters for freedom, and to give confidence to people in the defense of just causes.
